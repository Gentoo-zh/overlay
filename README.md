# commit message

It is recommended to run `pkgdev commit` to quickly generate commit messages.

* for non-version bump commit, commit message should be like this:

        $category/$package: one line short description message
        {empty line}
        multiple lines of description about why you change this.
        if you change to fix the bug, and if there is an GitHub
        issue entry for that bug, then point the bug link here.

* for version bump commit, commit message should be like this:

        $category/$package: add $new_version, drop $old_version

# Contributions

* We trust contributors that have commit rights, therefore commitors
  should think carefully before committing.

* Generative AI may be used to assist ebuild maintenance, but contributors must
  ensure the quality of related ebuild changes. In particular, verify functional
  correctness after modifications; applications, including CLI and GUI
  applications, should receive appropriate smoke testing through actual use
  before submission. Even when generative AI is used, the contributor remains
  the primary person responsible for every commit. The contributor, submitter,
  and commit author must be a human, not an AI tool or model identity such as
  Codex, GPT, Claude, Gemini, or similar systems.

* If you are sending a new pull request, make sure it contains all necessary commits
  for a single contribution, e.g. don't send two pull requests for an ebuild and its
  `Manifest`.

* Every ebuild change should not produce compile error before committing.

* Every ebuild should be tested in every ARCH that it KEYWORDS for.
  if not, don't claim that you support that keyword.

* Every ebuild is to have ~arch keywords. Stable keywords must not be used.

* Run `pkgcheck scan --commits --net` locally before you open pull request.
